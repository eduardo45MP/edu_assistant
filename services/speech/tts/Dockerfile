# Project: edu_assistant
# Component: speech-tts Docker image
# Responsibility:
#   Placeholder for packaging the text-to-speech service runtime.
#
# Architectural Notes:
#   - Converts text to audio output; does not interpret intent.
#   - Supports interface responses without executing actions.
#
# Related Documentation:
#   - docs/*/architecture.md
#   - docs/*/vision.md
#
# Important Constraints:
#   - Keep output deterministic and auditable when possible.
#   - Do not embed secrets or user data into the image.
