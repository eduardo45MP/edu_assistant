# Project: edu_assistant
# Component: memory Docker image
# Responsibility:
#   Placeholder for packaging the memory service runtime.
#
# Architectural Notes:
#   - Memory service stores context with explicit consent.
#   - This file does not define memory logic or persistence policy.
#
# Related Documentation:
#   - docs/*/architecture.md
#   - docs/*/vision.md
#
# Important Constraints:
#   - Do not bake secrets or user data into images.
#   - Keep persistence behavior defined in service code only.
