# Project: edu_assistant
# Component: connector-docs Docker image
# Responsibility:
#   Placeholder for packaging the documents connector runtime.
#
# Architectural Notes:
#   - Connectors access external data and normalize it for the system.
#   - This file does not define data access logic or provider policies.
#
# Related Documentation:

#   - docs/*/vision.md
#   - AGENTS.md
#
# Important Constraints:
#   - Connectors do not execute actions or make decisions.
#   - Do not embed credentials or provider-specific secrets here.
