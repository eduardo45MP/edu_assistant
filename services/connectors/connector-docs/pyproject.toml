# Project: edu_assistant
# Component: connector-docs package manifest
# Responsibility:
#   Placeholder for dependencies and metadata of the docs connector.
#
# Architectural Notes:
#   - Connectors access external data and normalize it for the system.
#   - This file does not define provider logic or access policies.
#
# Related Documentation:
#   - docs/*/architecture.md
#   - docs/*/vision.md
#   - AGENTS.md
#
# Important Constraints:
#   - Keep dependencies minimal and service-scoped.
#   - Do not encode provider credentials here.
