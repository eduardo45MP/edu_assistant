Project: edu_assistant
Component: interface-client package
Responsibility:
  Mark the interface-client service package boundary.

Architectural Notes:
  - The interface layer captures intent and presents responses.
  - This package does not execute actions or make decisions.

Related Documentation:

  - docs/*/vision.md
  - AGENTS.md

Important Constraints:
  - Keep interface logic thin and delegative.
  - Do not introduce tool execution or policy enforcement here.
