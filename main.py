Project: edu_assistant
Component: root entrypoint placeholder
Responsibility:
  Reserve a future top-level runner without defining runtime behavior yet.

Architectural Notes:
  - This file is intentionally minimal to keep service boundaries explicit.
  - It does not orchestrate, execute, or expose any service interface.

Related Documentation:
  - docs/*/architecture.md
  - docs/*/vision.md
  - AGENTS.md

Important Constraints:
  - Do not embed service logic or side effects here.
  - Keep orchestration and execution inside their dedicated services.
