# Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally incremental.
The goal is to deliver **useful, testable capabilities early**, while progressively expanding toward a more complete human–machine symbiosis system.

The project prioritizes learning, validation, and real-world usefulness over speculative completeness.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundations (useful core)

**Objective:** establish a working core that already provides practical value.

Focus areas:

* Define the core architecture (interfaces, orchestration, tools) ✓
* Basic voice or text input pipeline
* LLM-based intent interpretation
* Explicit command execution (no autonomy)
* Integration with a small set of tools/APIs

Expected outcomes:

* A functional assistant capable of executing clear, intentional commands
* Early validation of interaction patterns
* Clear boundaries between reasoning and execution

Examples:

* Create calendar events
* Retrieve information from selected sources
* Perform structured queries and summaries

---

## Phase 2 — Context and continuity

**Objective:** move beyond isolated commands toward contextual assistance.

Focus areas:

* Short-term context handling
* Session-based memory
* Improved intent disambiguation
* Safer tool invocation patterns

Expected outcomes:

* The assistant can understand follow-up commands
* Reduced need to restate context
* More natural interaction flows

Examples:

* “Reschedule that meeting”
* “Summarize the important emails from today”
* “Continue the research we started earlier”

---

## Phase 3 — Tool expansion and automation

**Objective:** increase usefulness by expanding the assistant’s action surface.

Focus areas:

* Integration with additional APIs and services
* Modular tool definitions
* Task automation workflows
* Permission and authorization boundaries

Expected outcomes:

* Broader operational capabilities
* Clear separation between intent and execution
* Increased productivity impact

Examples:

* Automated message drafting (with approval)
* Cross-platform searches
* Repetitive task automation

---

## Phase 4 — Multimodal and wearable interaction

**Objective:** reduce friction and improve availability.

Focus areas:

* Voice-first interaction refinement
* Wearable-based activation (e.g., bone-conduction headset)
* Low-latency response paths
* Non-intrusive notifications and alerts

Expected outcomes:

* Discreet, continuous access to the assistant
* Reduced dependence on screens
* More natural integration into daily life

---

## Phase 5 — Agent specialization and orchestration

**Objective:** evolve from a single assistant into a coordinated system.

Focus areas:

* Specialized agents (research, scheduling, analysis)
* Agent coordination via a central orchestrator
* Task delegation and aggregation
* Transparency of reasoning and actions

Expected outcomes:

* More complex tasks handled reliably
* Clear mental model of what the system is doing
* Improved scalability of capabilities

---

## Phase 6 — Long-term exploration

**Objective:** explore advanced symbiosis concepts responsibly.

Focus areas:

* Persistent long-term memory (opt-in)
* Deeper personalization
* Health and context-aware integrations
* Evaluation of productization opportunities

Notes:
This phase is exploratory and dependent on ethical, technical, and practical constraints.

## Guiding principles

* Utility before autonomy
* Explicit intent before action
* Transparency over magic
* Incremental trust-building
* Human-in-the-loop by default
