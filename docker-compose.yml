# Project: edu_assistant
# Component: local compose stack
# Responsibility:
#   Wire core services for local development and manual testing.
#
# Architectural Notes:
#   - Defines service composition only; does not encode business logic.
#   - Keeps orchestration, execution, and interface layers separated.
#
# Related Documentation:
#   - docs/*/architecture.md
#   - docs/*/vision.md
#
# Important Constraints:
#   - Not a production deployment manifest.
#   - Avoid embedding secrets or runtime policy decisions here.
